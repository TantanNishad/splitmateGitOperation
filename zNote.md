## 📂 Chapter 04: Diff, Stash, and Restore

- 🧾 `001.` **Git Diff**
   ✅ Common git diff examples:
          Command	         What it does
          git diff	         Shows changes in your working directory (before staging with git add)
          git diff --staged	 Shows changes that are staged (after git add, before git commit)
          git diff main	Shows    changes between your current branch and the main branch
          git diff HEAD	Shows    changes between the latest commit and your working directory

- 📦 `002.` **Git Stash**
        🧺 What is Git Stash?
            Think of git stash like a temporary storage box for your changes.

            🔹 You’re working on something, but suddenly need to switch branches or fix something else.
            🔹 You’re not ready to commit, but don’t want to lose your work.
            🔹 Use git stash to save your changes temporarily, clean your working directory, and come back to them later.

            📦 Basic Example
            Let’s say:

            You changed a file: zcontent.md

            But you suddenly need to switch branches

            Git won’t let you switch if you have uncommitted changes.

            ✅ Use:
            Terminal :
            git stash
            This:

            Saves your uncommitted changes

            Reverts your working directory to the last commit (clean state)

            Now you can safely switch branches or pull updates.

            🔄 Bring Back the Changes
            When you’re ready to go back to your work:

            Terminal :
            git stash pop
            This:

            Applies the latest stashed changes

            Removes them from the stash list

            Or:

            Terminal :
            git stash apply
            This applies the changes but keeps them in the stash, just in case.

            🧾 Multiple Stashes?
            Yes! Git saves each stash with an index:

            Terminal :
            git stash list
            Example output:

            less
            Copy
            Edit
            stash@{0}: WIP on main: update zcontent.md
            stash@{1}: WIP on main: test login fix
            To apply a specific one:

            Terminal :
            git stash apply stash@{1}
            To delete a specific stash:

            Terminal :
            git stash drop stash@{1}
            To clear all:

            Terminal :
            git stash clear
            📝 Summary Table
            Command	What it does
            git stash	Save your changes temporarily
            git stash list	        Show all stashed changes
            git stash apply	        Re-apply the latest stash (but keep it)
            git stash pop	        Re-apply and remove the latest stash
            git stash drop stash@{n}	Delete a specific stash
            git stash clear	        Delete all stashes

- ♻️ `003.` **Git Restore**
      🧯 What is git restore?
      git restore is used to undo changes in your working directory.

      Think of it as an “undo” button for files you haven't committed yet.

      🧱 Why Use git restore?
      When you:

      Made changes to a file

      But want to throw away those changes and go back to the last commit

      🧪 Example Scenario:
      You edited a file called index.html but don’t like the changes and want to undo them.

      ✅ Undo Unstaged Changes
      Terminal :
      git restore index.html
      🔹 This will reset index.html to how it was in the last commit.

      ❗ You lose those changes — they’re not saved!

      ✅ Undo All Unstaged Changes
      Terminal :
      git restore .
      🔹 This restores all files back to the last commit.

      ✅ Unstage a File (without losing changes)
      If you've used git add, but haven't committed yet:

      Terminal :
      git restore --staged index.html
      🔹 This unstages the file — takes it out of the staging area.

      Your file stays as-is, but it won’t be included in the next commit.

      🔄 Summary Table
      Command	What It Does
      git restore <file>	        Undo unstaged changes in the file
      git restore .	                Undo unstaged changes in all files
      git restore --staged <file>	Unstage a file (keep changes in working directory)

      👀 Before You Restore...
      Use this to check what's going to change:

      Terminal :
      git status
      Always good to double-check before restoring, since it can permanently remove changes.
- ♻️ `004.` **Git reset**
        ⚔️ git restore vs git reset — Simple Comparison
                Action	git restore	git reset
                ❌ Undo changes in working directory	✅ Yes	⚠️ Not directly
                🧼 Unstage a file (remove from staging area)	✅ Yes (--staged)	✅ Yes
                🕹 Change commit history	❌ No	✅ Yes (with flags like --soft, --mixed, --hard)
                💣 Can delete commits	❌ No	✅ Yes (with --hard, etc.)
                ✅ Safer for beginners	✅ Yes	⚠️ Be careful — can lose commits

                🔄 When to Use Each
                ✅ Use git restore when:
                You want to undo file changes (like pressing “undo” in an editor)

                You want to unstage files (like “remove from commit list”)

                Examples:
               Terminal :
                git restore file.txt             # undo changes
                git restore --staged file.txt    # unstage file
                ⚠️ Use git reset when:
                You want to move back in history

                You want to unstage files

                You’re okay with rewriting commits

                Examples:
               Terminal :
                git reset HEAD~1             # move one commit back (keeps changes)
                git reset --hard HEAD~1      # move back AND delete all changes
                git reset file.txt           # unstage a file (similar to restore --staged)
                👶 Beginner Tip:
                Start with git restore — it's safer and perfect for undoing local file changes or unstaging.

                Use git reset carefully, especially with --hard — it can permanently delete work if misused.

## 📂 Chapter 05: Git Branches
   
- 🌿 `001.` **Introduction to Git Branches**
         1.   Introduction to Git Branches
                Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to work collaboratively on code. One of its core features is branching, which enables multiple lines of development to exist independently.

                🔹 What is a Branch in Git?
                A branch in Git represents an independent line of development. You can think of it as a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. The default branch in most repositories is called main or master.

                Branches allow you to:

                Work on new features without affecting the main codebase.

                Fix bugs in isolation.

                Experiment safely.

                Collaborate without conflicts.

                🔹 How Branching Works
                When you create a new branch, Git creates a new pointer to the current commit.

                As you make new commits on that branch, Git moves the pointer forward.

                Switching between branches changes the files in your working directory to match that branch.

                🔹 Common Git Branch Commands
                Command	Description
                git branch	Lists all local branches
                git branch <branch-name>	Creates a new branch
                git checkout <branch-name>	Switches to the specified branch
                git checkout -b <branch-name>	Creates and switches to a new branch
                git merge <branch-name>	Merges the specified branch into the current one
                git branch -d <branch-name>	Deletes a branch

                🔹 Example Workflow
                bash
                Copy
                Edit
                # Start on main branch
                git checkout main

                # Create and switch to a new feature branch
                git checkout -b feature-login

                # Make some changes and commit them
                git add .
                git commit -m "Add login feature"

                # Switch back to main and merge changes
                git checkout main
                git merge feature-login
                🔹 Visualizing Branches
                Git tools like git log --oneline --graph --all or GUI clients (e.g., GitKraken, SourceTree, VSCode Git) can help visualize branches and merges.


        2.  Practical
                git branch
                git branch feature-button 
                git branch

                git checkout feature-button
                git branc
                git status
                git add .
                git commit - "add Contact Button"

                git  log --online
                git push origin freature-button
                git checkout feature-button

                git merge feature button
                git log --onine
                git push orginal main
                git branch -d feature-button

                git add .
                git push orgin main
                git push orign --delete feature-button

        You’re working on a website and want to add a "Contact Us" button. You’ll do this on a separate branch to avoid affecting the main branch until the feature is ready.

        ✅ Step-by-Step with Correct Commands and Explanations

        # 1. See existing branches
        git branch
        🔹 Shows all local branches. You'll see something like:


        * main

        # 2. Create a new branch for your feature
        git branch feature-button
        🔹 Creates a new branch called feature-button.


        # 3. Check branches again
        git branch
        🔹 Now you'll see:


        feature-button
        * main

        # 4. Switch to the new branch
        git checkout feature-button
        🔹 Now you're working on the feature-button branch.


        # 5. (Typo: git branc → git branch)
        git branch
        🔹 Double-check you’re on feature-button.


        # 6. Check the current file status
        git status
        🔹 Shows what files are changed, untracked, or staged.


        # 7. Stage all changes
        git add .

        # 8. Commit your changes
        git commit -m "Add Contact Button"
        🔹 Note: Your original line had a small error: - "add Contact Button" → -m "Add Contact Button"


        # 9. See the commit history in short format
        git log --oneline
        🔹 Shows commits like:

        sql
        Copy
        Edit
        e2a3f7c Add Contact Button
